        During January- April 2025, Thailand‚Äôs chicken export value grew by 8.79% yoy to USD 1.48 billion, with volume rising by 5.63% yoy to 391,000 tons.
The National Veterinary Quarantine Service Division in the Philippines has given the green light for two Thai companies to export raw poultry meat. They are Bangkok Ranch, a significant producer of ducks, and Panut Poultry Group, which specializes in frozen chicken. 
Narumon Pinyosinwat, Thailand‚Äôs Minister of Agriculture and Cooperatives, said this will be the first time the Philippines imports raw duck and chicken meat from Thailand. This success has helped Thailand open a new export market and has provided a significant opportunity for Thai farmers and entrepreneurs to increase their income. It also reflects the strong cooperation between Thailand and the Philippines in food security.
She added that the two certified factories are estimated to export 5,000 tons of poultry annually, equating to an estimated value of USD 15.28 million each year. With the potential certification of more factories, exports could account for about 25% of the Philippines‚Äô raw poultry import market.
The Ministry of Agriculture and Cooperatives and the Department of Livestock Development are committed to completing the required procedures to enable the export of raw poultry from Thailand to the Philippines, aiming for a potential start within this year.
Ms Narumon expects that the Philippines will approve more facilities to supply poultry products in the future, which would further benefit Thai farmers, especially since the raw chicken meat sector is significantly larger than that of cooked chicken.
A source from Panus Poultry Group told Poultry and Meat Asia Magazine that the company‚Äôs factory is certified to export raw chicken to the Philippines. However, she could not share the exact timeline for the first shipment.
‚ÄúNow, we are conducting an internal assessment as we are operating at full capacity and cannot take on additional orders,‚Äù she said, choosing not to disclose the company‚Äôs maximum capacity.  
Panus Poultry Group exports both raw and cooked chicken to Malaysia, Japan, and the EU
CP Foods sees opportunity in the duck market
CP Foods has successfully exported its duck products to Australia, shipping 100 tons of raw duck in 2024 and an additional quantity of cooked duck products.
Ekpiya Ua-wutthikrerk, President of CPF Food Network, a subsidiary of CP Foods, told Poultry & Meat Asia Magazine that to foster growth in the market, the company must launch new cooked duck offerings while exploring additional distribution channels to better reach customers.
This year, the company plans to export more cooked duck offerings and is assessing potential markets, including the Philippines.
In 2023, CP Foods was the first Thai company to export cooked duck meat to Australia.
Thailand‚Äôs chicken and duck exports
Last year, Thailand shipped 1.15 million tons of chicken, up 6.35% yoy, valued at USD 4.31 billion. The key markets were Japan, the UK, China, the Netherlands, Malaysia, South Korea, Singapore and Hong Kong.
Meanwhile, it exported USD 30.32 million worth of fresh, chilled, and frozen duck products to overseas markets, down 2.32% yoy. Its primary markets were Japan, Singapore, Hong Kong, South Africa, the UAE, and South Korea.
According to the Ministry of Commerce, from January to April 2025, chicken export value grew by 8.79% yoy to USD 1.48 billion, with volume rising by 5.63% yoy to 391,000 tons. It exported USD 8.52 million of duck products, down 15.87%.
